        <p>
            I'm Hill, a software engineer from Lagos, Nigeria. 
            I sometimes like to think that programming is how I like to express my creative interests by building functional, user-friendly and aesthetically appealing applications that solve different problems around me.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I have a diploma in computer science, I still enjoy writing, consuming knowledge about history, art, faith and physics and talking about it in my pass-time.

            When I'm not building more things into the simulation of our existing space-time continum, I spend tiime in my home city in Lagos, Nigeria with my quite large family and friends. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I first learned how to program by building things for the web, so when I build I tend to turn to JavaScript (or TypeScript these days), React, or if I'm building fullstack applications, GraphQl in the backend.

            When I'm not building web applcaitions or interfaces, I tend to tinker in my interest in building software for embedded systems and work towards my aspiration of being an embedded systems engineer/robotics system engineer sometime in the near future.
